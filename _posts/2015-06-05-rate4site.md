### Raw Rates
By default Rate4Site _only_ outputs normalized rates as z-scores. To also have Rate4Site return the raw rates add the "-y" flag followed by the name of an output file. Here is an example command:

{% highlight bash %}
rate4site -s mySequences.phy -t myTree.txt -o rates.txt -y raw_rates.txt -Ml
{% endhighlight %}

### Large Sequence Alignments and Trees (>200 taxa)
Rate4Site suffers from memory problems when using large numbers of sequences (>200). To alleviate some of these problems, Rate4Site has to be compiled with "Makefile\_slow", which you can read more about [here](http://www.tau.ac.il/~itaymay/cp/rate4site.html). Even with this specially compiled version of Rate4Site, _do not attempt to run Rate4Site with more than 300 sequences because it will not work_! If you have more than 300 sequences in your input alignment, it's best to downsample to 300 sequences before running Rate4Site.
