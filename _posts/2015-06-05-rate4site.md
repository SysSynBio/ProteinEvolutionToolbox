## Raw Rates
By default Rate4Site _only_ outputs normalized rates as z-scores. To also have Rate4Site return the raw rates add the "-y" flag followed by the name of an output file. Here is an example command:

{% highlight bash %}
rate4site -s mySequences.phy -t myTree.txt -o rates.txt -y raw_rates.txt -Ml
{% endhighlight %}
